# Checkpoint

Git is an incredibly powerful tool, but a supercomputer is [not needed to run doom](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/it-runs-doom). For this project, I wanted to create  
a version control system for files you just want to keep on your computer. Some standalone files do not merit an  
entire repo to themselves, but being able to save a checkpoint you could come back to would be handy. This program  
addresses that problem using the appropriately versatile language C.


Some DataStructs/ files come from my [Systems Programming class](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse333/19su/) and reflect my own original work (in addition to the skeleton that was provided to me by the course)
